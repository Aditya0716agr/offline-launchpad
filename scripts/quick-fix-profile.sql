-- Quick fix for profile creation - run this in Supabase SQL Editor

-- Temporarily disable RLS to allow profile creation
ALTER TABLE public.profiles DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Create a simple profile for the current user if they don't have one
-- (Replace 'your-email@example.com' with your actual email)

-- Re-enable RLS
